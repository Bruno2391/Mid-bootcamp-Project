This project was created in a scenario where a bank, after a year of activity, decides to launch a credit campaign, in this sense it wants to know:
who are our worst customers, and who is our target audience for launching the campaign.
After analyzing the data, it appears that:
1- The worst customers are:
Customers with a checking account little or rich, with little saving accounts, with one age <23 and >42, duration of credit > 27 months are bad, with high skilled employe/employe/employer and unskilled/ unemployed/non-residence, persons of the female sex, concerning the housing with free or rent house, and the purpose of the credit for business, domestic aplliances, education, furniture, repairs and vacations.
2- For the launch of the campaign our target it will be: 
Customers with none checking account, none, moderate, quite rich or rich, with ages between 23 and 42, duration of credit with 12 or 24 months , with skilled employee/offical or unskilled residents, concerning the housing with a status of own house, we prefer persons of the male sex, and the purpose of the credit with car or radio/tv.
